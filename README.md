Overview
This project is an Airbnb host recruitment analysis conducted as part of the Applied Statistics in Marketing Intelligence course at the University of San Francisco. The analysis aims to identify the optimal types of listings, host profiles, and amenities that contribute to higher customer satisfaction and profitability.

Research Questions
The project investigates three key questions:

What types of listings should Airbnb recruit?

We analyzed the impact of property type, room type, accommodation size, and neighborhood on listing performance.

Should Airbnb prioritize listings managed by companies or individuals?

We compared the performance of individual hosts (1-3 listings) versus larger-scale hosts.

What amenities should Airbnb incentivize hosts to offer?

We evaluated amenities based on their impact on revenue, customer satisfaction, and cost-benefit trade-offs.

## Key Findings

Best Listing Type: Entire homes or apartments accommodating at least 6 guests in Eastern, Southeastern, or Central San Francisco show the highest ratings and revenue.

Best Host Type: Individual hosts managing 1-3 listings achieve the highest ratings and revenue, outperforming large-scale hosts.

Top Amenities to Offer: Hair dryers, free street parking, dishwashers, self-check-in, and WiFi significantly enhance guest experience and profitability.

## Technologies & Methodologies

Data Analysis: R (linear regression, visualization, statistical modeling)

Visualization: ggplot2 for insights on property types, host types, and amenities



Dataset: San Francisco Airbnb listings (5,704 listings)
